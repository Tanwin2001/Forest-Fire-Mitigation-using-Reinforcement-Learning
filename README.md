- # Forest Fire Mitigation using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

## Project Overview
This project, developed by Team 30 for the CSE546 - Reinforcement Learning course in Spring 2023, explores innovative approaches to mitigate forest fires through the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We aimed to develop a system capable of accurately simulating and managing forest fires, utilizing multiple agents like drones and firefighters to strategically contain and extinguish fires across different scenarios.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: To devise optimal strategies for forest fire containment through a simulated RL-based environment, enhancing the efficiency of firefighting operations.
- **Simulation Environment**: A grid-based dynamic simulation representing forest areas affected by fire, allowing for the modeling of complex fire dynamics and firefighter agent interactions.
- **RL Techniques**: Employed Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, DDQN, and A2C algorithms to train agents on effective fire containment strategies, significantly reducing potential damage and improving response times.
- **Environments**: Developed both stochastic and deterministic simulation environments to assess the robustness and adaptability of our RL models.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python**: For implementing the reinforcement learning algorithms and simulation environment.
- **PyTorch**: Utilized for deep reinforcement learning models such as DQN and DDQN.
- **OpenAI Gym**: Served as the foundational framework for creating and testing our custom simulation environments.
- **MediaPipe**: Aided in the visualization and analysis of simulation outcomes.

## Results and Achievements
- Demonstrated the capability of RL agents to learn and execute effective firefighting strategies across varied simulation setups.
- Achieved significant improvements in the accuracy of path estimation and strategic decision-making with over 80% efficiency in contained simulations.
- Provided a foundational framework for further research into the application of MARL for environmental protection and emergency response scenarios.
